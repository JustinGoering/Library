This project was created as part of my homework for the third semester course Programming 3.
It is a library as a client server application with a database.
There are two types of clients, the standard user and the admin.
Both can search for books, borrow them and return them.
The admin can also add and delete books, as well as delete all tables in the database. 
When the server is started, a connection to the database is established and initial values are entered into it via an SQL file.
